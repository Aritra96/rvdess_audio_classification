### Summary

Audio classification for different emotions in speech (AKA Speech Emotion Recognition or SER) using Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS).

### About Data

Speech audio-only files (16bit, 48kHz .wav) from RAVDESS. Full dataset of speech and song, audio and video (24.8 GB) available from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/1188976). Construction and perceptual validation of the RAVDESS is described in our Open Access paper in [PLoS ONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196391).

This portion of the RAVDESS contains 1440 files: 60 trials per actor x 24 actors = 1440. The RAVDESS contains 24 professional actors (12 female, 12 male), vocalizing two lexically-matched statements in a neutral North American accent. Speech emotions includes calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprise, and disgust expressions. Each expression is produced at two levels of emotional intensity (normal, strong), with an additional neutral expression.
